"" In statistical hypothesis testing, explain the difference between Type I and Type II error.
You should be able to provide an example on the fly here. ""

Letâ€™s take an example to understand the concept of Hypothesis Testing. 
A person is on trial for a criminal offense and the judge needs to provide a verdict on his case. Now, there are four possible combinations in such a case:

First Case: The person is innocent and the judge identifies the person as innocent
Second Case: The person is innocent and the judge identifies the person as guilty  (Type I error)
Third Case: The person is guilty and the judge identifies the person as innocent   (Type II error)
Fourth Case: The person is guilty and the judge identifies the person as guilty
