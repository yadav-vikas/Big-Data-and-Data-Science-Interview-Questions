Suppose you enter an ice cream store. They sell two types of ice cream: soft serve and frozen yogurt. 
Additionally, there are 10 flavors of soft serve and 13 flavors of frozen yogurt.
You're really hungry, so you decide you can order and eat two ice creams before they melt, but are facing some decision fatigue given the amount of choices.
How many ways are there to choose exactly two ice creams from the store? Figuring this out should help quantify that decision fatigue.


------- As mentioned in problem only 2 can be eaten before they melt

probability of eating 2 ice creams out of 13 flavour or frozen yogurt and 10 flavors of soft serve is 

 >>>>>>>>>>>>>   10c2 13c0 + 10c1 13c1 + 10c0 13c2
