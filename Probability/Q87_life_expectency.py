Q. Suppose you're analyzing a population of 100,000 people, and you're trying to understand life expectancy. 
 Within this population of 100,000 people, 75% can expect to live to the age of 70, 
 while 45% can expect to live to age 80. Given that a person is 70, what is the probability that they live to the age 80?  

>>>>
Let S be the event that life expectency of 100k people is 75% who lives upto 70,

Let E be the event that life expectency of 100k people is 45% who lives upto 80,

By Baye's Rule      P(E|S) = P(S|E) x P(E) / P(S)

as given that whoever lives upto age 80 is under 70+ category as well,
 
  so P(S|E) = 1
  
- Given that a person is 70, what is the probability that they live to the age 80 will be   P(E|S) 

  P(E|S)  = (1 x (45/100)) / (75/100) = 0.6
  
  So there is 60% chance that a person who is 70 will live to the age of 80.
